Thousands of organizations around the world use GitHub and Jira together to manage software projects. With your GitHub account linked to Jira, it gives your team the ability to see branches, commit messages, and pull request in the Jira tickets theyâ€™re working on. On the GitHub side, you can view relevant Jira ticket information in issues and pull requests.

Once the GitHub account is connected with Jira, there is no need to switch between Github & Jira and the entire team will be able to see the work status.

## Migration

The legacy ability to connect Jira Software and GitHub via the Jira DVCS connector is now deprecated in favor of this new **GitHub-maintained integration**. Once the migration is complete, the legacy integration (DVCS connector) is disabled automatically.

1. Go to [https://github.com/marketplace/jira-software-github](https://github.com/marketplace/jira-software-github) and click **Install**

2. During installation, you will be asked to select repositories you want to use with the Jira Integration
