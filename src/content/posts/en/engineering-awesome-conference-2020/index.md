We love engaging with the tech community, and we are big consumers of the awesome work that people share online. So a couple of weeks ago we hosted our [first-ever online conference](https://www.nodesagency.com/engineering-awesome-conference-2020/) as a way to give back to the community. 6 experts from across our offices in Europe and the Middle East shared their knowledge in topics like Flutter, Vapor, Sitecore and more. After each talk, we had a Q&A session as well so participants can freely ask their questions on the topic.

All the talks are available on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BorderlessEngineeringConference) so you can watch or rewatch them at any time. You can also find the presentations slides [here](https://github.com/nodesagency/events-slides/tree/master/Engineering%20Awesome%20Conference%202020).

_Here are a few behind the scenes photos from our facilitator and speakers._

This talk will give you a quick introduction into setting up AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service). We will also be setting up workflows on GitHub Actions for automatically deploying our app on pushes to GitHub.
After this talk, you will have an idea of how to utilize AWS ECS to get your Laravel app up and running in the Cloud. And how to utilize GitHub Actions for your CI/CD system.

Vapor 4 is released! â€“ So let's have a look at what's new. Some of the topics we'll cover are the changes to Fluent, to database models and the support for eager loading.
Vapor is the most popular Server Side Swift framework. It is written on top of Apple's SwiftNIO, a cross-platform asynchronous event-driven network application framework. You can read more about Vapor [here](https://vapor.codes/).

#### Android Compose

_by [Johnny SÃ¸rensen](https://twitter.com/jeghedderjohnny), Head of Android from our Copenhagen office_

We time travel to the year 2021 in a world where Compose is the standard of the presentation layer on Android. We will have a quick look at how Compose works, a glimpse into structuring an app and how it can work piecing data streams together and ultimately compare it to the ancient days of XML. You can download the code used in this session [here](https://github.com/johsoe/moviedb-compose).
