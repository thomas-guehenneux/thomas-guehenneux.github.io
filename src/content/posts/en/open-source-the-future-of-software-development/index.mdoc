## Types of Open Source Software and Licenses
![](src/content/posts/en/open-source-the-future-of-software-development/image01.webp)
Open source software is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.
In this chapter, we will explore the various types of open source software and the licenses that govern their use.

There are many different types of software, each with its own unique characteristics and uses.In this article, we will focus on four main categories:

* **Free software** - software that is available to users at no cost, regardless of whether the source code is open or closed.
* **Commercial software** - software that is sold to users for a fee, regardless of whether the source code is open or closed.
* **Proprietary software** - software with a closed source code that is owned and controlled by a particular company or individual.
* **Open-source software** - software with an open source code that is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

When it comes to open source software, the licenses that govern their use are an important consideration.
These licenses outline the terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed, and understanding the various licenses and their associated requirements is key to properly using and distributing open source software.

Some common types of open source licenses include:

* **MIT License** - a permissive license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software without many restrictions. It does not require users to distribute the source code or make their own changes available to others.
* **GNU General Public License (GPL)** - a copyleft license that requires users to make the source code and any changes they make available to others. It also requires that any software distributed using GPL-licensed code must be distributed under the same license.
* **Apache License** - a permissive license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software without many restrictions. It requires users to include a copy of the license and give credit to the original authors.
* **Creative Commons (CC)** - a set of licenses that allow users to use, modify, and distribute creative works, such as images, videos, and music, under various levels of restriction.

It is important to carefully review the terms of the specific license associated with the open source software you are using, as the requirements can vary significantly.
Failure to properly follow the terms of the license can result in legal consequences.
In addition to the above licenses, there are many other types of open source licenses available, each with its own unique features and requirements.
Understanding the various types of open source software and their associated licenses is key to making the most of the vast resources and community support that the open source movement has to offer.

Open source software has many advantages, including the ability to attract talent, build trust with users, and drive innovation.
It is an important part of the software ecosystem and has enormous potential for shaping the future of software development.

## Advantages of Open Source

There are many advantages to using open source software.
One of the biggest is the ability to attract talent through advertising.
Companies like Google and Red Hat are able to attract top developers by openly sharing their code and inviting contributions from the community.
In addition, open source software can be a great way to build trust with users, as the open nature of the code allows for transparency and honesty.

Other advantages of open source include:

* **Lower costs** - since open source software is freely available, it can save organizations money on licensing fees.
* **Greater flexibility** - with open source software, users have the freedom to modify the code to fit their specific needs and can even hire developers to make customizations.
* **Stronger security** - the open nature of open source software allows for a larger community of developers to review and identify potential security vulnerabilities, leading to stronger security.
* **Faster innovation** - the ability to access and contribute to the source code allows for faster development and innovation.

Overall, open source software offers a number of advantages that can help organizations save money, increase flexibility, improve security, and drive innovation.
It is an important part of the software ecosystem and has enormous potential for shaping the future of software development.

## Open Source Fears
![](src/content/posts/en/open-source-the-future-of-software-development/image04.webp)
Despite the many benefits of open source, there are still some common fears and misconceptions surrounding its use.
One common fear is that code will be stolen or used for nefarious purposes. However, there are numerous licenses available for open source software that can protect against this, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), which requires that any modifications or derived works also be released under the GPL.

Another fear is that code will be "spied on" by competitors.
In reality, it would take a significant amount of time and resources for a company to parse through even a moderate-sized open source codebase, making this fear largely unfounded.
In addition, the open nature of open source software allows for greater transparency and accountability, making it less likely that malicious actors would be able to successfully hide their activities within the code.

Other common concerns about open source include:

* **Lack of support** - some users may be concerned about the availability of support for open source software. However, many open source projects have active communities that provide support and documentation, and there are also companies that offer paid support for open source software.
* **Lack of control** - since open source software is freely available for anyone to use and modify, some users may be concerned about losing control over their code. However, careful selection of an appropriate license can help protect against this.
* **Quality concerns** - some users may be concerned about the quality of open source software, as it is developed by a community rather than a single company. However, the open nature of open source software allows for a larger number of developers to review and improve the code, leading to higher overall quality.


While there are some valid concerns about open source software, the many benefits it offers often outweigh the potential risks. By understanding the different licenses available and carefully selecting the right one for your needs, you can effectively protect your code and take advantage of the benefits of open source.

## Examples

There are many successful companies that have embraced open source and are using it to drive innovation and growth.
Google has open sourced over 20 million lines of code in 900+ projects, while Red Hat has more than 100 open source projects and Facebook has around 300
repositories. Twitter also has a number of open source projects, showing that open source can be successful in a variety of industries.

All of these companies are successful, all profitable, and all of them are important contributors to open source.
I think they could be a great example for all of us.

### The Enormous Potential of Linux
The platform itself changes 9 times an hour!
Ten thousand lines of code are added every day.
About five thousand lines are changed and about eight thousand lines are removed.
It’s by far the highest velocity, most effective software development process in the history of computing!
It’s all about open source. It’s all about Linux!
